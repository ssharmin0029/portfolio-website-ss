For this project I was required to build a portfolio from scratch. A portfolio is a great way to showcase skills and talents to employers. Not only that, it's a place where you can have all your work for anyone to see and your own reference. It can be a stepping stone to a developer's success. This project was challenging task indeed, writing not only css but html as well from scratch made all the difference. It was a great learning experience.
